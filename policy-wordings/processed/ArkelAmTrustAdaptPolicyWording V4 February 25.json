      "question": "Can I rent out my property on Airbnb or as a holiday let?",
      "answer": "Possibly, but you MUST notify the insurer and the policy terms will change. Standard home insurance assumes owner-occupation or standard tenancy agreements.

Specifically: theft cover is restricted when let unless forcible entry/exit or deception to enter; unoccupancy provisions may apply between lets; public liability cover may need adjustment. Do NOT assume you're covered - always notify insurer before starting any letting arrangement.",
