If an event happens during the policy period but you don't notify the claim until after the policy expires, there will be no cover. You must notify claims within 180 days of the event.",
      "section_reference": "Introduction, Page 4"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this policy for disputes with my short-term rental guests?",
      "answer": "No. The policy specifically excludes 'any claims related to or caused by your hosting activity or against a guest.' This exclusion appears in multiple sections (Contract Disputes, Property Protection, General Exceptions). Despite being marketed as 'Hosting Family' insurance, it does not cover disputes with guests.",
      "section_reference": "General Exceptions, Sections 7 & 8"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my property is unoccupied for extended periods?",
      "answer": "If the principal home is not lived in by an insured person for 30 or more consecutive days, or a total of 90 or more days during the policy period, it is considered 'unoccupied' and property protection claims during that time will not be covered. This is particularly relevant for hosts who may travel frequently.",
      "section_reference": "Definitions - Unoccupied, Section 8 - Property Protection"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the insurer pay for small claims court cases?",
      "answer": "No professional fees are covered for small claims. The policy will only provide legal advice for small claims matters, but will not pay for legal representation or professional fees. Small claims are those allocated or likely to be allocated to the small claims track.",
      "section_reference": "General Exceptions, Definitions - Small Claims"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I choose my own solicitor?",
      "answer": "Initially, no. The insurer/administrator will appoint an authorised representative. However, if legal proceedings must commence or it's mandatory for you to be represented by a solicitor, you may choose an alternative solicitor with the insurer's written agreement (which won't be unreasonably withheld). The insurer will only pay fees up to the amount they would have paid their appointed representative (\u00a3100+VAT per hour).",
      "section_reference": "Making a Claim, Page 5"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'reasonable prospect of success' mean and who decides?",
      "answer": "It means your claim has a greater than 50% chance of being wholly successful, both at the time of reporting and throughout the claim. The administrator or insurer makes this assessment. If they decide there's no reasonable prospect and you disagree, they'll instruct an alternative representative for a second opinion. If both say no prospects, no cover is provided.",
      "section_reference": "Definitions - Reasonable Prospect of Success, Making a Claim"
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly must I report an employment dispute?",
      "answer": "You must report employment dispute claims within 30 days of dismissal or becoming aware of discrimination. If you report within 30 days but don't follow the advice of the administrator or representative, you won't be covered. There's also a \u00a3250 excess for employment claims.",
      "section_reference": "Section 3 - Employment Disputes"
    },
    {
      "question": "Are criminal prosecution costs covered?",
      "answer": "Only for strict liability offenses (where you didn't know you were committing a crime) and only if you're successfully acquitted of all charges. You must report within 14 days of being made aware. Motor vehicle offenses, sexual offenses, and any deliberate crimes are excluded. The insurer only pays costs after any legal aid or other recoverable amounts are applied first.",
      "section_reference": "Section 4 - Criminal Prosecution Defence"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm advised to accept a settlement offer but want to continue?",
      "answer": "If you, the administrator or the authorised representative receives professional advice to accept a settlement offer (including Part 36 offers) but you choose not to, any professional fees incurred after that point will not be covered. The insurer may also require barrister advice on whether to accept settlement offers.",
      "section_reference": "General Exceptions, General Terms and Conditions"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the 24/7 legal helpline instead of making a formal claim?",
      "answer": "The helpline provides initial free verbal legal advice but cannot replace formal claim notification. Using the helpline does NOT constitute notification of a claim. You must still report claims formally within the required timeframes (typically 180 days). Delays in formal notification may reduce or prevent assistance and could make you liable for additional costs.",
      "section_reference": "Section 1 - 24/7 Free Legal Advice Service"
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the maximum the insurer will pay in total?",
      "answer": "\u00a375,000 maximum per period of insurance for all claims combined. This includes professional fees, defendant's costs, and rehabilitation costs. Within this, employment disputes are capped at \u00a350,000 and rehabilitation treatment at \u00a35,000. Education appeals have a separate \u00a35,000 limit. Once limits are reached, no further claims are paid that period.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'principal home' requirement and why is it so important?",
      "answer": "The principal home must be the property in the schedule where you are registered on the electoral roll. It must be your only or main residence. It cannot be a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO), B&B or hotel. If you change address, you must request written acceptance from the insurer for the new address. This is fundamental to eligibility - if the property doesn't qualify, there's no cover.",
