      "question": "What does 'unoccupied' mean and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Unoccupied means not lived in and not occupied overnight by you, your family or an authorised person for more than 30 consecutive days. This matters because many covers cease or are restricted when the home is unoccupied - particularly theft, malicious damage, escape of water, and escape of oil. If planning to be away for more than 30 days, contact insurer to discuss options.",

    {
      "question": "Am I covered for accidental damage?",
      "answer": "Standard AXA Extra policies include LIMITED accidental damage: (Contents) entertainment equipment, mirrors, fixed glass, glass furniture tops; (Buildings) pipes, cables, sanitary ware, fixed glass in windows/doors/fanlights. For FULL accidental damage cover to contents and/or buildings, you need to purchase the optional 'Plus Accidental Damage' cover which will be shown in your schedule. Even with full accidental damage, there are exclusions including gradual damage, wear and tear, poor maintenance, mechanical breakdown, and damage during repairs/cleaning.",

    {
      "question": "What happens if my contents/buildings sum insured is too low?",
      "answer": "Your contents sum insured must equal 100% of the full replacement cost of all your contents as new. Your buildings sum insured must equal 100% of the full rebuilding cost (not market value). If the sum insured is less than 100% of the full value, you will only be paid up to the sum insured shown in your schedule, NOT the full cost to replace/rebuild. It's essential to regularly review and update your sum insured to ensure adequate cover.",

    {
      "question": "What should I do if my home will be empty for more than 30 days?",
      "answer": "Contact your insurer BEFORE the 30 day period expires. Cover for escape of water ceases after 30 days unoccupied. Theft, malicious damage, and escape of oil are also excluded while unoccupied. You must either: keep central heating on low to prevent freezing, OR drain the central heating system and turn off water at mains. Consider whether you need specialist unoccupied property insurance if absence will be prolonged.",

    {
      "question": "Am I covered for storm damage to my fence/gate?",
      "answer": "No. Loss or damage to gates, hedges and fences is specifically excluded under storm cover. Gates, hedges and fences are only covered if damaged by other insured perils such as fire, theft, malicious damage, riot, or collision by vehicles/aircraft/animals. They are also excluded from subsidence cover unless the main building is damaged at the same time by the same cause.",

      "question": "What is the difference between 'occupiers liability' and 'property owners liability'?",
      "answer": "OCCUPIERS AND PUBLIC LIABILITY (Contents section, up to \u00a32m) covers your liability arising from OCCUPATION of the home and private pursuits - i.e. you living there and day-to-day activities. PROPERTY OWNER'S LIABILITY (Buildings section, up to \u00a32m) covers your liability arising from OWNERSHIP of the buildings (but not occupation) and defective work on properties you've sold. If you both own and occupy your home, you need both covers. If you're a tenant, you need occupiers liability. If you're a landlord not living there, you need property owner's liability.",

      "question": "My washing machine pipe burst and caused water damage - am I covered?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is covered under Escape of Water. The policy covers water leaking from washing machines, dishwashers, water beds, fridges and freezers. However, the excess applies. Note: damage to the washing machine itself is only covered if caused by an insured peril. The cost to repair/replace the burst pipe itself is not covered - you pay for this. The policy covers the CONSEQUENTIAL damage the escaping water caused to your home and contents. If the home has been unoccupied for more than 30 days, there is NO cover.",

    {
      "question": "I left my bath running and it overflowed causing damage - am I covered?",
      "answer": "Not under standard cover. Damage caused by sinks and baths overflowing as a result of taps being left on is specifically excluded from the Escape of Water cover. However, IF you have purchased the optional 'Plus Accidental Damage' cover for contents and/or buildings, this type of damage may be covered under that section (subject to accidental damage exclusions and excess).",

      "question": "Are my belongings covered when I take them outside the home?",
      "answer": "LIMITED cover under standard policy: Contents can be temporarily removed to (1) bank/safe deposit (2) other private occupied/furnished dwelling (3) place where you're working/temporarily living worldwide. Limits apply including \u00a32,500 max for theft from student accommodation. For COMPREHENSIVE away-from-home cover, you need to purchase optional PERSONAL POSSESSIONS cover which provides worldwide cover up to the sum insured shown in your schedule. This covers items anywhere in the world but has specific exclusions (unattended vehicles, unlocked hotel rooms, etc.).",

      "question": "What is covered under 'subsidence' and what's excluded?",
      "answer": "COVERED: Downward movement of the site caused by subsidence, or upward/sideways movement caused by heave, or landslip. EXCLUDED: Settlement (natural movement of new buildings), damage to boundaries/gardens/drives/pools unless main building damaged at same time, damage due to construction/alteration/demolition, coastal or river bank erosion, damage from defective materials/design/workmanship, damage to solid floor slabs and non-loadbearing walls unless foundations beneath external walls damaged at same time. A specific excess applies (shown in schedule). These claims can be complex - report as soon as you notice cracking or movement.",

    {
      "question": "Will you pay the full cost to replace my damaged carpet/floor covering?",
      "answer": "Only for the damaged area. If a floor covering is damaged beyond repair, the policy will only pay to replace the damaged floor covering in that room. It will NOT pay for undamaged floor covering in adjoining rooms, even if the replacement doesn't match. This is stated in the 'Matching sets, suites and carpets' section of How we settle claims.",

    {
      "question": "My laptop was stolen from my car - am I covered?",
      "answer": "Depends on circumstances and what cover you have. Under CONTENTS 'Temporary Removal' cover: only covered if stolen from unattended vehicle when items were HIDDEN FROM VIEW in locked boot or glove compartment AND all doors including boot were LOCKED. If these conditions not met, no cover. Under PERSONAL POSSESSIONS cover (if purchased): max \u00a31,000 for theft from unattended vehicle (excluding pedal cycles) and same conditions apply about items being locked out of sight. Laptops in plain view are NOT covered.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the policy cover gradual damage and wear and tear?",
      "answer": "NO. This is a key exclusion. The policy specifically excludes 'loss or damage caused gradually or by wear and tear, depreciation, effects of light or atmosphere, mould, dry or wet rot or fungus and costs that arise from the normal use, maintenance and upkeep of buildings and contents.' Home insurance covers sudden, unexpected insured events - not deterioration over time or lack of maintenance. You are required to maintain your property in good repair. Damage that would have been prevented by proper maintenance is not covered.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How long do I have to report a claim?",
      "answer": "You must report claims AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. For theft or malicious damage, you must contact the Police URGENTLY and obtain a crime or lost property reference number. Unreasonable delay in reporting may prejudice your claim. If requested, you must send written details within 30 days. Any writ, summons, letter of claim or other legal document must be sent to the insurer AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Early reporting allows insurer to investigate properly, arrange emergency action if needed, and preserve evidence.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use my own builder/repairer or do I have to use yours?",
      "answer": "The insurer may appoint an approved supplier to validate your claim and arrange quotation, repair or replacement. Permanent repairs by approved suppliers are guaranteed. However, you have a choice: If the insurer offers repair/replacement through a preferred supplier but you choose cash settlement instead, payment will NOT EXCEED the amount the insurer would have paid the preferred supplier. This could be less than the cost of using your own builder. If no equivalent replacement is available, full replacement cost will be paid with no discount. The insurer may also repair/reinstate/replace directly or pay cash/cash alternative (including vouchers/store cards).",
