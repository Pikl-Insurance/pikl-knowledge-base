You also cannot claim for damage caused by your tenant under Contents (or theft/malicious damage by paying guests, tenants or lodgers). However, if you have Buildings cover, your liability as owner of the property is covered. If you have Contents cover and are also the occupier, you have occupier's liability cover.

    {
      "question": "Are my belongings covered when I take them away from home?",

This provides worldwide cover for things you wear or carry like clothing, jewellery, watches, gadgets, sports equipment, and personal money.

      "answer": "If your home can't be lived in because it's been damaged by an insured event (listed in Buildings paragraphs 1-8 or Contents paragraphs 1-8), the insurer will pay reasonable costs for alternative accommodation for you and your pets until it's fit to live in, up to \u00a3100,000 (Buildings) or \u00a310,000 (Contents).

It's NOT the market value of your home. If the sum insured is too low and you provided it (rather than Aviva providing \u00a31,000,000), your claim may be reduced proportionately. For example, if you only paid 70% of the premium you should have paid, you'd only get 70% of your claim. Contact the insurer if you don't think the sum insured is enough.

These are called 'specified valuables' and will be listed on your schedule with individual values.

      "question": "What is the Family Legal Protection and when can I use it?",
      "answer": "Family Legal Protection provides a 24/7 legal advice helpline (0800 051 1701) and covers legal costs (up to the limit on your schedule) for disputes in: employment (unfair dismissal, discrimination, unpaid wages), property (boundaries, nuisance, damage, sale/purchase, landlord disputes as tenant), consumer (faulty goods/services), personal injury, and medical/cosmetic negligence. A lawyer will assess if your case has reasonable prospects of success (more likely than not to win) and whether costs are proportionate to the claim value. You must contact them as soon as an issue arises. Not covered: matrimonial/divorce matters, libel/slander, judicial review, planning, disputes if you let property out as landlord.",

      "question": "Can I use my own repairer or do I have to use one chosen by the insurer?",
      "answer": "The insurer can choose to settle your claim by repairing, rebuilding, replacing or making a payment. They may appoint their own contractors. If you want to use your own repairer, discuss this with the claims handler. However, you must not arrange repairs without the insurer's agreement first, as this could affect your claim. If the insurer is able to repair/replace but agrees to cash settlement, they'll only pay what it would have cost them to do the work.",
