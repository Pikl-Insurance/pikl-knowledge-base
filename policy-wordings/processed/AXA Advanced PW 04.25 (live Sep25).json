AXA defines storm as: wind gusts 48+ knots (55mph), OR rainfall 25mm+/hour, OR snow 30cm+ in 24 hours, OR hail damaging hard surfaces/breaking glass. However, AXA considers multiple factors when assessing storm claims, not just this definition.

Not covered for gates, hedges, fences.",

      "question": "What if I am underinsured?",
      "answer": "If your contents sum insured is less than 100% of the full replacement value of all your contents, AXA will only pay a proportionate amount of any claim. For example, if you insured for \u00a350,000 but should have insured for \u00a3100,000 (only 50% of correct value), AXA would only pay 50% of any claim. You must notify AXA if the full value exceeds your sum insured.",
