      "answer": "Yes, malicious damage is covered under Cause 4 (Buildings) and Cause 4 (Landlord's Contents), subject to the policy excess. However, there is no cover while the property is unoccupied, and malicious damage caused by you (the policyholder) is excluded.",

      "answer": "If your sum insured is less than 100% of the full rebuilding cost (for buildings) or full replacement value (for contents), we will settle claims proportionately based on the percentage of premium you paid versus what you should have paid. For example, if you're insured for \u00a3600,000 but should be insured for \u00a3700,000 (you paid only 86% of correct premium), we'll pay only 86% of valid claims.

However, there is no cover while the property is unoccupied, no cover for damage caused by failure of sealant/grout, and the pipe itself is only covered if damaged by an insured cause.

If it has started, you get a pro-rata refund (unless claims made). After the cooling-off period, you can cancel anytime with pro-rata refund if no claims and refund exceeds \u00a315.

Also, storm is strictly defined (48 knot winds OR 25mm/hour rainfall OR 30cm snow in 24 hours OR damaging hail), but AXA considers other factors beyond just the definition when assessing claims.",

      "answer": "You must maintain the property in good repair (General Condition 4). Damage caused by gradual deterioration, wear and tear, or lack of maintenance is excluded throughout the policy (General Exclusion 9). For example, if a pipe bursts due to wear and tear, the water damage may be covered but not the pipe replacement. Poor maintenance can also result in claims being declined, particularly for storm, escape of water, and subsidence claims.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the inflation protection work?",
      "answer": "Sums insured for buildings and landlord's contents are automatically reviewed and adjusted monthly based on official indices (House Rebuilding Cost Index for buildings, Consumer Durables RPI for contents). We won't reduce sums insured if indices fall. No extra charge until renewal, when premium is recalculated on revised sums insured. However, you should not rely solely on this - you must ensure sums insured are adequate, especially after extensions or major purchases.",

      "question": "What should tenants do in an emergency?",
      "answer": "Tenants should: (1) Take immediate steps to prevent further damage (turn off water/gas/electricity at mains); (2) Call the 24-hour emergency helpline 0370 646 4952 for urgent tradesperson assistance (tenant/landlord pays contractor costs); (3) Do not conduct permanent repairs before inspection; (4) Inform you (the landlord) immediately so you can contact AXA claims team on 0330 024 6842. For alternative accommodation needs, AXA will discuss reasonable options considering the circumstances.",
