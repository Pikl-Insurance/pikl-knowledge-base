Key exclusions include wear and tear, damage from lack of maintenance, properties left empty for over 30 days, pet damage, vermin infestations, mechanical breakdowns, and damage during renovations. The policy also doesn't cover business use (beyond basic home office), certain high-value items like mobile phones and virtual currencies, or catastrophic events like war and terrorism.",
        "customer_impact": "These exclusions mean customers need to maintain their home regularly and can't claim for damage that develops slowly over time or results from neglect. If they're planning to leave their property empty for more than a month, they must notify AXA or risk voiding their coverage. Customers with pets should understand that damage caused by their animals isn't covered, and those working from home need to verify their equipment is within policy limits. For extended absences, renovations, or business use beyond basic home office work, customers may need additional coverage or policy adjustments. Items like mobile phones, drones, and certain valuables require separate insurance if they want them protected.",

However, it's important to know that residential properties in the UK may still have some protection through industry-wide arrangements for terrorism, though coverage is limited. For everyday risks like fire, theft, storms, and accidental damage, your policy still provides comprehensive protection.

If these items are left out in the open\u2014such as jewelry on a dresser, cash on a counter, or a laptop left visible in plain sight\u2014they won't be covered if stolen or damaged. The policy expects reasonable care to be taken. This means valuables should be stored securely when not in use, such as in drawers, safes, or locked cabinets.

As long as items aren't left sitting out unattended, you're covered.",

        "customer_impact": "For property owners renting their home short-term through platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo, this means you need to understand what gaps exist in your coverage. The policy protects against guest damage during verified bookings, but you'll need to keep detailed records including police reports for theft or malicious damage. Your everyday belongings are covered, but expensive single items worth over \u00a35,000 need separate coverage. Pet damage from guests' animals isn't covered, so you may want to consider a no-pet policy. The policy only works during active hosting periods with valid bookings - your regular home insurance should cover non-hosting times. You also can't claim for loss of income in the first 14 days after an incident or for bookings made after the damage occurs.",

Also, any single valuable item worth more than \u00a35,000 would need additional coverage.",

It won't cover pandemic-related situations, structural issues if you're in an apartment, or if you're doing renovations.
