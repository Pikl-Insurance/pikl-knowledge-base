## Common Questions

### What does 'unoccupied' mean and why does it matter?

**Policy Details:**
- Insurer: AXA Insurance UK plc
- Policy Type: Home Insurance

Unoccupied means not lived in and not occupied overnight by you, your family or an authorised person for more than 30 consecutive days. This matters because many covers cease or are restricted when the home is unoccupied - particularly theft, malicious damage, escape of water, and escape of oil. If planning to be away for more than 30 days, contact insurer to discuss options.

*Reference: Meanings of defined terms page 12, General exclusions, Specific cause exclusions throughout*

**Tags:** common, axa insurance uk plc, home insurance

### Am I covered for accidental damage?

**Policy Details:**
- Insurer: AXA Insurance UK plc
- Policy Type: Home Insurance

Standard AXA Extra policies include LIMITED accidental damage: (Contents) entertainment equipment, mirrors, fixed glass, glass furniture tops; (Buildings) pipes, cables, sanitary ware, fixed glass in windows/doors/fanlights. For FULL accidental damage cover to contents and/or buildings, you need to purchase the optional 'Plus Accidental Damage' cover which will be shown in your schedule. Even with full accidental damage, there are exclusions including gradual damage, wear and tear, poor maintenance, mechanical breakdown, and damage during repairs/cleaning.

*Reference: Contents Cover 12-13, Buildings Cover 21-22, Contents Plus Accidental Damage Cover page 37, Buildings Plus Accidental Damage Cover page 49*

### What happens if my contents/buildings sum insured is too low?

**Policy Details:**
- Insurer: AXA Insurance UK plc
- Policy Type: Home Insurance

Your contents sum insured must equal 100% of the full replacement cost of all your contents as new. Your buildings sum insured must equal 100% of the full rebuilding cost (not market value). If the sum insured is less than 100% of the full value, you will only be paid up to the sum insured shown in your schedule, NOT the full cost to replace/rebuild. It's essential to regularly review and update your sum insured to ensure adequate cover.

*Reference: General Conditions page 14-15, How we settle claims pages 23-24*

### What should I do if my home will be empty for more than 30 days?

**Policy Details:**
- Insurer: AXA Insurance UK plc
- Policy Type: Home Insurance

Contact your insurer BEFORE the 30 day period expires. Cover for escape of water ceases after 30 days unoccupied. Theft, malicious damage, and escape of oil are also excluded while unoccupied. You must either: keep central heating on low to prevent freezing, OR drain the central heating system and turn off water at mains. Consider whether you need specialist unoccupied property insurance if absence will be prolonged.

### Am I covered for storm damage to my fence/gate?

- Insurer: AXA Insurance UK plc
- Policy Type: Home Insurance

OCCUPIERS AND PUBLIC LIABILITY (Contents section, up to £2m) covers your liability arising from OCCUPATION of the home and private pursuits - i.e. you living there and day-to-day activities.

### Can I use my own builder/repairer or do I have to use yours?

**Policy Details:**
- Insurer: AXA Insurance UK plc

However, you have a choice: If the insurer offers repair/replacement through a preferred supplier but you choose cash settlement instead, payment will NOT EXCEED the amount the insurer would have paid the preferred supplier. This could be less than the cost of using your own builder. If no equivalent replacement is available, full replacement cost will be paid with no discount. The insurer may also repair/reinstate/replace directly or pay cash/cash alternative (including vouchers/store cards).

### How much should I insure my buildings for?

**Policy Details:**
- Insurer: Aviva Insurance Limited
- Policy Type: Home Insurance

Your buildings sum insured must be high enough to cover the FULL cost of rebuilding your home to the same specification, including demolition, debris removal, and architects'/surveyors' fees. It's NOT the market value of your home. If the sum insured is too low and you provided it (rather than Aviva providing £1,000,000), your claim may be reduced proportionately. For example, if you only paid 70% of the premium you should have paid, you'd only get 70% of your claim. Contact the insurer if you don't think the sum insured is enough. The sum insured is index-linked monthly using the House Rebuilding Cost Index.

### Can I use my own repairer or do I have to use one chosen by the insurer?

**Policy Details:**

### How does the inflation protection work?

However, you should not rely solely on this - you must ensure sums insured are adequate, especially after extensions or major purchases.
