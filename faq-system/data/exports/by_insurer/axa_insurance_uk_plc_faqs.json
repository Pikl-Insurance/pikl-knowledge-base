For FULL accidental damage cover to contents and/or buildings, you need to purchase the optional 'Plus Accidental Damage' cover which will be shown in your schedule.

Your buildings sum insured must equal 100% of the full rebuilding cost (not market value). If the sum insured is less than 100% of the full value, you will only be paid up to the sum insured shown in your schedule, NOT the full cost to replace/rebuild.

Note: damage to the washing machine itself is only covered if caused by an insured peril. The cost to repair/replace the burst pipe itself is not covered - you pay for this.

However, you have a choice: If the insurer offers repair/replacement through a preferred supplier but you choose cash settlement instead, payment will NOT EXCEED the amount the insurer would have paid the preferred supplier. This could be less than the cost of using your own builder. If no equivalent replacement is available, full replacement cost will be paid with no discount.

      "question": "What if my buildings or contents sum insured is too low?",
      "answer": "If your sum insured is less than 100% of the full rebuilding cost (for buildings) or full replacement value (for contents), we will settle claims proportionately based on the percentage of premium you paid versus what you should have paid. For example, if you're insured for \u00a3600,000 but should be insured for \u00a3700,000 (you paid only 86% of correct premium), we'll pay only 86% of valid claims. You must notify AXA if values exceed your sums insured.",

However, there is no cover while the property is unoccupied, no cover for damage caused by failure of sealant/grout, and the pipe itself is only covered if damaged by an insured cause. You pay for the pipe repair itself, but damage caused by the leaking water is covered.",
